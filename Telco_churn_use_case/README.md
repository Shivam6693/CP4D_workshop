# Predict Customer Churn using Watson Machine Learning and Jupyter Notebooks on Cloud Pak for Data

In this Code Pattern, we use IBM Cloud Pak for Data to go through the whole data science pipeline to solve a business problem and predict customer churn using a Telco customer churn dataset. Cloud Pak for Data is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists, developers, and others interested in data science can use tools (e.g., RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, Spark, etc.) to collaborate, share, and gather insight from their data as well as build and deploy machine learning and deep learning models.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to load, visualize, and analyze data
* Run Notebooks in [IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cloud-pak-for-data)
* Build, test and deploy a machine learning model using [Spark MLib](https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) on Cloud Pak for Data.
* Deploy a selected machine learning model to production using Cloud Pak for Data
* Test the deployed model using the exposed endpoint

> **Important**: *Make sure that you stop the kernel of your notebook(s) when you are done, in order to conserve memory resources!*

![Stop kernel](doc/source/images/JupyterStopKernel.png)

### 2. Create a Space for Machine Learning Deployments

Before we create a machine learning model, we will have to set up a deployment space where we can save and deploy the model.

Follow the steps in this section to create a new deployment space. If you already have a deployment space set up, you can skip this section and follow the steps to [upload the dataset](#3-upload-the-dataset).

- Navigate to the left-hand (☰) hamburger menu and choose `Analyze` -> `Analytics deployments`:

![(☰) Menu -> Analytics deployments](doc/source/images/ChooseAnalyticsDeployments.png)

- Click on `+ New deployment space`):

![Add New deployment space](doc/source/images/addNewDeploymentSpace.png)

Give your deployment space a unique name, optional description, then click `Create`.

![Create New deployment space](doc/source/images/createNewDeploymentSpace.png)

### 3. Upload the dataset

If you are not on the [Cloud Pak for Data Learning Path](https://developer.ibm.com/series/cloud-pak-for-data-learning-path/), which uses Virtualized Data, upload the dataset into your project now, else skip down to [import notebook to Cloud Pak for Data](#4-import-notebook-to-cloud-pak-for-data).

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/
cd telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d
```

In your project, on the `Assets` tab click the `01/00` icon and the `Load` tab, then either drag the `data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` file to the window or navigate to it using `browse for files to upload`:

![Add data set](doc/source/images/cpd-add-data-set.png)

### 4. Import notebook to Cloud Pak for Data

At the project overview, either click the `+Add to project` button, and choose `Notebook`, or, if the *Notebooks* section exists,  to the right of *Notebooks* click `+ New notebook`:

Click the `+Add to project` button and choose `Notebook`:

![Add notebook](doc/source/images/wml-1-add-asset.png)

On the next panel select the *From URL* tab, give your notebook a name, provide the following URL, and choose the Python 3.6 environment:

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/master/notebooks/Telco-customer-churn-ICP4D.ipynb
```

![Add notebook name and URL](doc/source/images/wml-2-add-name-and-url.png)

When the Jupyter notebook is loaded and the kernel is ready then we can start executing cells.

![Notebook loaded](doc/source/images/wml-3-notebook-loaded.png)

> **Important**: *Make sure that you stop the kernel of your notebook(s) when you are done, in order to conserve memory resources!*

![Stop kernel](doc/source/images/JupyterStopKernel.png)

> **Note**: The Jupyter notebook included in the project has been cleared of output. If you would like to see the notebook that has already been completed with output, you can refer [examples/Telco-customer-churn-ICP4D-with-output.ipynb](examples/Telco-customer-churn-ICP4D-with-output.ipynb).

### 5. Run the notebook

Spend a minute looking through the sections of the notebook to get an overview. A notebook is composed of text (markdown or heading) cells and code cells. The markdown cells provide comments on what the code is designed to do.

You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the `Run` button at the top of the notebook or hitting the keyboard short cut to run the cell (Shift + Enter but can vary based on platform). While the cell is running, an asterisk (`[*]`) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. `[17]`).

**Please note that some of the comments in the notebook are directions for you to modify specific sections of the code. Perform any changes as indicated before running / executing the cell.**

#### Notebook sections

With the notebook open, you will notice:

- Section `1.0 Install required packages` will install some of the libraries we are going to use in the notebook (many libraries come pre-installed on Cloud Pak for Data). Note that we upgrade the installed version of Watson Machine Learning Python Client. Ensure the output of the first code cell is that the python packages were successfully installed.
- Section `2.0 Load and Clean data` will load the data set we will use to build out the machine learning model. In order to import the data into the notebook, we are going to use the code generation capability of Watson Studio.
  - Highlight the code cell shown in the image below by clicking it. Ensure you place the cursor below the `import pandas as pd` line.
  - Click the 01/00 "Find data" icon in the upper right of the notebook to find the data asset you need to import.
  - If you are following the [Cloud Pak for Data Learning Path](https://developer.ibm.com/series/cloud-pak-for-data-learning-path/), choose the *Files* tab, and pick the virtualized data set that has all three joined tables (i.e. `User<xyz>.BILLINGPRODUCTSCUSTOMERS`). Click `Insert to code` and choose `Insert Pandas DataFrame`.

![Add remote Pandas DataFrame](doc/source/images/wml-4-add-dataframe.png)

  - If you are using this notebook without virtualized data, you can use the Telco-Customer-Churn.csv file version of the data set that has been included in the project. Click `Insert to code` and choose `Insert Pandas DataFrame`.

![Add local Pandas DataFrame](doc/source/images/wml-3-add-local-dataframe.png)

  - The code to bring the data into the notebook environment and create a Pandas DataFrame will be added to the cell.
  - Run the cell and you will see the first five rows of the dataset.

![Generated code to handle Pandas DataFrame](doc/source/images/wml-5-generated-code-dataframe.png)

> **IMPORTANT**: Since we are using generated code to import the data, you will need to update the next cell to assign the `df` variable. Copy the variable that was generated in the previous cell (it will look like df=data_df_1, data_df_2, etc) and assign it to the `df` variable (for example df=df_data_1).

- Continue to run the remaining cells in section 2 to explore and clean the data.
- Section `3.0 Create a model` cells will run through the steps to build a model pipeline.
  - We will split our data into training and test data, encode the categorial string values, create a model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, and evaluate the model against the test set.
  - Run all the cells in section 3 to build the model.

![Building the pipeline and model](doc/source/images/wml-6-build-pipeline-and-model.png)

- `Section 4.0 Save the model` will save the model to your project.

- In the first cell under section 4.0, update the `MODEL_NAME` variable and provide a unique and easily identifiable model name. Next, update the `DEPLOYMENT_SPACE_NAME` variable, providing the name of your deployment space which was created in [Step 2](#2-create-a-space-for-machine-learning-deployments) above.

![Provide model and deployment space name](doc/source/images/wml-provide-model-and-space-name.png)

- We will be saving and deploying the model to the Watson Machine Learning service within our Cloud Pak for Data platform. In the next code cell, be sure to update the `wml_credentials` variable.
  - The url should be the hostname of the Cloud Pak for Data instance.
  - The username and password should be the same credentials you used to log into Cloud Pak for Data.

![Update WML credentials](doc/source/images/wml-7-update-wml-credentials.png)

Continue to run the cells in the section to save the model to Cloud Pak for Data. We'll be able to test it out with the Cloud Pak for Data tools in just a few minutes!

> **Note**: You can use the following cell for cleaning up any previously created models and deployments.

![Clean up models and deployments](doc/source/images/cleanup-models-and-deployments.png)

### 6. Deploying the model using the Cloud Pak for Data UI

Now that we have created a model and saved it to our respository. We will want to deploy the model so it can be used by others. 

We will be creating an online deployment. This type of deployment will make an instance of the model available to make predictions in real time via an API. 

Although we use the Cloud Pak for Data UI to deploy the model here, the same can also be done programmatically.

- Navigate to the left-hand (☰) hamburger menu and choose `Analyze` -> `Analytics deployments`:

![Analytics Analyze deployments](doc/source/images/AnalyzeAnalyticsDeployments.png)

- Choose the deployment space you setup previously by clicking on the name of the space.

- In your space overview, select the model name that you just built in the notebook and click the 3 dots under `Actions`, and choose `Deploy`:

![Actions Deploy model](doc/source/images/ActionsDeployModel.png)

On the `Configure and Deploy` screen, choose `Online` for the *Deployment Type*, give the deployment a name and optional description and click `Create`:

![Online Deployment Create](doc/source/images/OnlineDeploymentCreate.png)

Once the status shows as *Deployed*, you can click on the deployment name to begin testing:

![Status Deployed](doc/source/images/StatusDeployed.png)

### 7. Testing the model

Cloud Pak for Data offers tools to quickly test out Watson Machine Learning models. We begin with the built-in tooling.

#### Test the saved model with built-in tooling

- Click on the *Test* tab and paste the following into the *Enter input data* cell:

```json
{
   "input_data":[
      {
         "fields":[
            "gender",
            "SeniorCitizen",
            "Partner",
            "Dependents",
            "tenure",
            "PhoneService",
            "MultipleLines",
            "InternetService",
            "OnlineSecurity",
            "OnlineBackup",
            "DeviceProtection",
            "TechSupport",
            "StreamingTV",
            "StreamingMovies",
            "Contract",
            "PaperlessBilling",
            "PaymentMethod",
            "MonthlyCharges",
            "TotalCharges"
         ],
         "values":[
            [
               "Female",
               0,
               "No",
               "No",
               1,
               "No",
               "No phone service",
               "DSL",
               "No",
               "No",
               "No",
               "No",
               "No",
               "No",
               "Month-to-month",
               "No",
               "Bank transfer (automatic)",
               25.25,
               25.25
            ]
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

- Click `Predict` and the model will be called with the input data. The results will display in the *Result* window. Scroll down to the bottom (Line #114) to see either a "Yes" or a "No" for Churn:

![Testing the deployed model](doc/source/images/TestingDeployedModel.png)

#### Test the deployed model with cURL

Now that the model is deployed, we can also test it from external applications. One way to invoke the model API is using the cURL command.

> NOTE: Windows users will need the *cURL* command. It's recommended to [download gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for this, as you will also have other tools and you will be able to easily use the shell environment variables in the following steps. Also note that if you are not using gitbash, you may need to change *export* commands to *set* commands.

- In a terminal window (or command prompt in Windows), run the following command to get a token to access the API. Use your Cloud Pak for Data cluster `username` and `password`:

```bash
curl -k -X GET https://<cluster-url>/v1/preauth/validateAuth -u <username>:<password>
```

- A json string will be returned with a value for "accessToken" that will look *similar* to this:

```json
{"username":"scottda","role":"Admin","permissions":["access_catalog","administrator","manage_catalog","can_provision"],"sub":"scottda","iss":"KNOXSSO","aud":"DSX","uid":"1000331002","authenticator":"default","accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InNjb3R0ZGEiLCJyb2xlIjoiQWRtaW4iLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9ucyI6WyJhY2Nlc3NfY2F0YWxvZyIsImFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3IiLCJtYW5hZ2VfY2F0YWxvZyIsImNhbl9wcm92aXNpb24iXSwic3ViIjoic2NvdHRkYSIsImlzcyI6IktOT1hTU08iLCJhdWQiOiJEU1giLCJ1aWQiOiIxMDAwMzMxMDAyIiwiYXV0aGVudGljYXRvciI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJpYXQiOjE1NzM3NjM4NzYsImV4cCI6MTU3MzgwNzA3Nn0.vs90XYeKmLe0Efi5_3QV8F9UK1tjZmYIqmyCX575I7HY1QoH4DBhon2fa4cSzWLOM7OQ5Xm32hNUpxPH3xIi1PcxAntP9jBuM8Sue6JU4grTnphkmToSlN5jZvJOSa4RqqhjzgNKFoiqfl4D0t1X6uofwXgYmZESP3tla4f4dbhVz86RZ8ad1gS1_UNI-w8dfdmr-Q6e3UMDUaahh8JaAEiSZ_o1VTMdVPMWnRdD1_F0YnDPkdttwBFYcM9iSXHFt3gyJDCLLPdJkoyZFUa40iRB8Xf5-iA1sxGCkhK-NVHh-VTS2XmKAA0UYPGYXmouCTOUQHdGq2WXF7PkWQK0EA","_messageCode_":"success","message":"success"}
```

- You will need to save the access token to a temporary environment variable. Use the export command to save the "accessToken" part of this response in the terminal window to a variable called `WML_AUTH_TOKEN`:

```bash
export WML_AUTH_TOKEN=<value-of-access-token>
```

- Back on the model deployment page, gather the `URL` to invoke the model from the *API reference* by copying the `Endpoint`:

![Model Deployment Endpoint](doc/source/images/ModelDeploymentEndpoint.png)

- Now save that endpoint to a variable named URL by exporting it.

```bash
export URL=https://blahblahblah.com
```

Now run this cURL command from a terminal to invoke the model with the same payload we used previously:

```bash
curl -k -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header "Authorization: Bearer  $WML_AUTH_TOKEN" -d '{"input_data": [{"fields": ["gender","SeniorCitizen","Partner","Dependents","tenure","PhoneService","MultipleLines","InternetService","OnlineSecurity","OnlineBackup","DeviceProtection","TechSupport","StreamingTV","StreamingMovies","Contract","PaperlessBilling","PaymentMethod","MonthlyCharges","TotalCharges"],"values": [["Female",0,"No","No",1,"No","No phone service","DSL","No","No","No","No","No","No","Month-to-month","No","Bank transfer (automatic)",25.25,25.25]]}]}' $URL
```

A json string will be returned with the response, including a "Yes" of "No" at the end indicating the prediction of if the customer will churn or not.

### 8. Create a Python Flask app that uses the model

You can also access the web service directly through the REST API. This allows you to use your model for inference in any of your apps. For this code pattern, we'll be using a Python Flask application to collect information, score it against the model, and show the results.

#### Install dependencies

The general recommendation for Python development is to use a virtual environment ([`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)). To install and initialize a virtual environment, use the `venv` module on Python 3 (you install the virtualenv library for Python 2.7):

In a terminal, go to the cloned repo directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/
cd telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d
```

Initialize a virtual environment with [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

```bash
# Create the virtual environment using Python. Use one of the two commands depending on your Python version.
# Note, it may be named python3 on your system.
python -m venv venv       # Python 3.X
virtualenv venv           # Python 2.X

# Source the virtual environment. Use one of the two commands depending on your OS.
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac or Linux
./venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows PowerShell
```

> **TIP** To terminate the virtual environment use the `deactivate` command.

Finally, install the Python requirements.

```bash
cd flaskapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Update environment variables

It's best practice to store configurable information as environment variables, instead of hard-coding any important information. To reference our model and supply an API key, we'll pass these values in via a file that is read, the key-value pairs in this files are stored as environment variables.

Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env`.

```bash
cp env.sample .env
```

Edit `.env` to reference the `URL` and `TOKEN`.

* `URL` is your web service URL for scoring.
* `TOKEN` is your deployment access token.

```bash
# Required: Provide your web service URL for scoring.
# E.g., URL=https://9.10.222.3:31843/dmodel/v1/project/pyscript/tag/score
URL=

# Required: Provide your web service deployment access token.
#           This TOKEN will be the part after `accessToken`. So, your
#           json string will look like:
#           {"username":"scottda","role":"Admin","permissions":["administrator","can_provision","manage_catalog","virtualize_transform","access_catalog"],"sub":"scottda","iss":"KNOXSSO","aud":"DSX","uid":"1000331001","authenticator":"default","accessToken":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2 <snip> neQ","_messageCode_":"success","message":"success"}
# The value for `TOKEN=` below will be:
#    TOKEN=eyJhbGciOi <snip> neQ

TOKEN=
```

#### Start the application

Start the flask server by running the following command:

```bash
python telcochurn.py
```

Use your browser to go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and try it out.

> **TIP**: Use `ctrl`+`c` to stop the Flask server when you are done.

#### Sample output

The user inputs various values

![Input a bunch of data...](doc/source/images/input.png)

The churn percentage is returned:
